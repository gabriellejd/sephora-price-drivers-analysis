# sephora-price-drivers-analysis

Project Overview: 
This project analyzes Sephora product data to examine what drives beauty product pricing and consumer ratings. Using exploratory analysis and multiple predictive models, it evaluates the influence of brand, size, category, and engagement metrics on price and perceived value.

Why this project is useful: 
Coming from a highly competitive industry, beauty brands must justify pricing and differentiate products beyond marketing. This project demonstrates how business analytics and modeling can be used to evaluate pricing driver and distinguish between objective vs subjective signals (price vs. ratings) for products to support data-informed pricing and product strategy decisions.
